#### Types
* There are two kinds of types in Go: those that are values and those that are references to values.
* When a variable is assigned to another variables or passed to a function, the value of the variable is always copied.
* If the variable type is a reference, then the assignment or function parameter pass results in reference value copy and hence the pass by reference semantic.
