##### Using MQSC command line
* To backspace: use Ctrl-Backspace in the shell. [Reference](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21240694)
* For more flexibility and to combine the result with other shell tools using pipes or to be included in a shell script:
	* `echo "MQSC command" | mqsc QMGR_NAME`
